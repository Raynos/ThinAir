## Goals

The main goal of *ThinAir* is to give a basic but versatile set of tools to Node.js user and newcomers for building web applications. 

This ain't no revolution, but a simple, concised way of achieving what you want without having to re-invent the wheel.

Another goal I have in mind while doing this project is to show everyone (even **PHP** developers!) that Node.js projects are fun, flexible and can finally replace those old technologies once and for all.
